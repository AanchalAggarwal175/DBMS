The earliest types of database management systems consisted mainly of hierarchy and network models.

The hierarchy model is one where each node or component has a child/parent relationship with one other node or component.

In the network model, the difference is that a single component can have multiple relationships – think of this as a single node being able to “multicast” connections.

However, over time, these models became overtaken by something called a relational database. In the relational database model, individual components have attributes that are 
linked to their identities through a database table design. The rows and columns of an individual database table include those identities and attributes in such a way that 
traditional structured query language or SQL can be used to pull various kinds of information on these relational models.
